# FEWD - Just a FEW Development

FEWD is yet another lightweight PHP framework.

It can be used as a foundation for a new project, or as a complement to any other framework, due to its modular approach.

## Usage

Fewd can be uploaded anywhere in your project (let's say, under `/Lib`).

	<?php

		include 'Lib/Fewd.php';
